# rdf-playground
A quick self-teaching class on how to use RDFs with Python

## Accessing the Class

### From GitHub

You can statically view the class by opening the [rendered output on GitHub](notebook.ipynb)

### Local Development

If you want to run a JupyterLab server locally and play with the notebook, you can use the included docker-compose file to jumpstart your local environment:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Once JupyterLab starts running, it will print to the docker-compose log the URL to access the server with an embedded authentication token.
